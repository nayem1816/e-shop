# e-Shop

An e-commerce project typically involves building a website that allows users to browse and purchase products or services online. The basic functionality of an e-commerce project would include the ability to add products to a virtual shopping cart, process payments, and manage customer accounts and orders. Additional features could include product reviews, recommendations, and the ability to track order status. A back-end system would also be required to manage inventory, process payments, and handle shipping and taxes.
